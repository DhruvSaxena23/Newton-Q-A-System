# Newtons Q&A: Question and Answer System Based on Google Palm LLM and Langchain for E-learning company  

About this Project This project involves creating an end-to-end Q&A system using Google Palm and Langchain for Newto School, an e-learning company specializing in DS-related courses. The system will cater to thousands of learners who ask questions via Discord or email. It will feature a Streamlit-based user interface where students can ask questions and receive answers efficiently. 

## Project Highlights

- Use a real CSV file of FAQs that Newton School is using right now. 
- Their human staff will use this file to assist their course learners.
- We will build an LLM based question and answer system that can reduce the workload of their human staff.
- Students should be able to use this system to ask questions directly and get answers within seconds

## You will learn following,
  - Langchain + Google Palm: LLM based Q&A
  - Streamlit: UI
  - Huggingface instructor embeddings: Text embeddings
  - FAISS: Vector databse
